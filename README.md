# World Flip - Entry for PyGames

## Inspiration

My inspiration for World Flip came from the idea of a world-changing device that could flip the laws of physics and alter the very fabric of reality. I wanted to create a game that incorporated this concept in a unique way, and the idea of a regular platformer experience, spiced up with this **twist**

## What it does

In World Flip, players assume the role of a heroic snake on a mission to save their world from cybernetic invaders armed with a device capable of flipping entire planets. To succeed, players must navigate treacherous levels and ultimately destroy the world flipper to save their home planet.

Clone it from the [Github repo](https://github.com/PetarRan/world-flip) and from root simply run:
```bash
py main.py
```

## How I built it

World Flip was built using the Python programming language and the `Pygame` framework. I tried to utilize a range of tools and libraries, including Pygame's sprite and event systems, to create a smooth and immersive gameplay experience. Additionally, I incorporated various game design principles and mechanics to ensure that players would be constantly engaged and challenged throughout the game.

## Challenges I ran into

One of the biggest challenges I faced was creating a levels. It can be an absolute nightmare with a game like this. Every level needs to be tested for all possible rotations. I also had to overcome technical hurdles related to game physics as this is my first time coding any kind of game.

## Accomplishments that i'm proud of

I am extremely proud of the overall design and gameplay mechanics of **World Flip**, which i believe creates a unique and engaging experience for players.

## What we learned

Developing World Flip was an incredibly rewarding experience that taught me a lot about game development and the importance of collaboration and iteration. I've learned valuable lessons about game design, pygame framework, and problem-solving that i'll carry into future projects.

## What's next for World Flip

Moving forward, I am excited to continue improving and expanding upon World Flip, adding new levels, enemies, world bosses, and features to create an even more immersive and engaging experience for players. I am also exploring opportunities to bring World Flip to new platforms and audiences, and i am excited to see where this journey takes us.
